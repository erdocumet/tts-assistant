# Finally, a modular Text-to-Speech assistant designed with simplicity in mind!
Please note to implement yourself you need to...
- Download a VOSK model and place it in a directory called "model"
- Run speak.sh at least once (running main.py should do this) to download the nessesary piper-tts models for the Text-to-Speech functionality.

This project is heavily under construction; most features are not complete yet.
