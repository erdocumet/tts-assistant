# A modular Text-to-Speech assistant with simplicity in mind
A virtual assistant (think: Alexa, Siri, etc.) that is small and modular and designed to be implemented on top of other projects to make human-machine interaction more natural. Still a work in progress...

# Dependancies
This has dependancies! Notably, to function fully offline this project uses VOSK voice recognition and piper-tts for text-to speech. For this to work, you must:
1. Download a VOSK model and place it in a directory called "model"
2. Run speak.sh at least once (running main.py should do this) to download the nessesary piper-tts models for the Text-to-Speech functionality.

Note: Again, this is a work in progress! This project is heavily under construction; most features are not complete yet and code is very spaghetti-esque.
